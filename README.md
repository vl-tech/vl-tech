# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Vladimir Ivanov!

### ðŸŒŸ About Me:
I'm passionate about **DevOps**, **Python** and **Go** programming, and **Cloud Infrastructure**. My focus is on scripting automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), and developing scalable, automated solutions using modern tools and frameworks.

### ðŸ’» Technologies I work with:
- **DevOps**: Utilizing [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) to automate deployments, configuration management, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Programming**: Comfortable with [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) for backend development and automation.
- **Scripting**: Automating tasks with [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Go](https://golang.org/).
- **Virtualization**: Experienced with [LXD/LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/), [Incus Containers](https://incus.net/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Podman](https://podman.io/), and [QEMU-KVM](https://www.qemu.org/).
- **Monitoring**: Skilled in setting up monitoring with [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), and [Icinga2](https://icinga.com/).
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Skilled in deploying and managing cloud services with an emphasis on scalability and resilience.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Building robust infrastructures using code to create reproducible environments and automate the management of resources.
