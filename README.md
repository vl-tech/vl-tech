# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Vladimir Ivanov!

### ðŸŒŸ About Me:
I'm passionate about **DevOps**, **Python** and **Go** programming, and **Cloud Infrastructure**. My focus is on scripting automation, infrastructure as code (IaC), and developing scalable, automated solutions using modern tools and frameworks.

### ðŸ’» Technologies I work with:
- **DevOps**: Using tools like [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) to automate and streamline deployments, configuration management, and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Programming**: Fluent in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/), I'm constantly exploring the depths of both languages for backend development and automation.
- **Scripting**: Love automating tasks with [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), and [Go](https://golang.org/).
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Skilled in deploying and managing cloud services and infrastructure with an emphasis on scalability and resilience.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Building robust infrastructures using code to create reproducible environments and automate the management of resources.
